# Form Builder
    A drag-and-drop form builder application that allows users to create dynamic forms with configurable fields, rules, and real-time previews. Built with React, Zustand, and @dnd-kit, it supports exporting form structures as JSON for seamless integration.
## ðŸ“– Overview
    The Form Builder enables users to:

        * Drag and drop fields (Text, Select, Radio, Checkbox, Date, etc.) to create custom forms.
        * Configure rules, e.g., show "Programming Language" field if "Industry" is "IT".
        * Preview forms in real-time to test logic.
        * Export form configurations as JSON, including fields, rules, and validations.

    This project is ideal for creating dynamic forms for surveys, data collection, or business applications.
## ðŸŽ¯ Features

### Drag-and-Drop Interface:
    Drag fields from a sidebar to a canvas to build forms.


### Field Rules:
    Define conditional logic (if-then) for fields, e.g., show/hide based on user input.


### Real-Time Preview:
    Test form logic and interactions via a preview modal.


### JSON Export:
    Export form structure (fields, types, rules, validations) as JSON.
